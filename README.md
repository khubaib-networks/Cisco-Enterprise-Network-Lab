# 🧠 Cisco Packet Tracer Enterprise Lab – HSRP, OSPF, VLAN, NAT, DHCP

This project simulates a full-scale **enterprise network topology** built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, covering advanced concepts like:

- 🔄 Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
- 🌐 OSPF Multi-Area Routing (Area 0 & Area 1)
- 🧩 VLAN Segmentation (10, 20, 30)
- 🧰 Inter-VLAN Routing via SVIs
- 🌍 NAT with simulated Internet access
- 📶 DHCP for automatic IP assignment
- 🔌 Trunking & Layer 2/3 separation
- 🔁 STP (Spanning Tree) for loop prevention

💾 All configurations and the `.pkt` file are included, along with a step-by-step device configuration guide.
